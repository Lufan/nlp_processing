Good movie, but much objectionable material unfortunately
The movie is very entertaining, but to call it a childrens' movie is to ignore significant content that really should not be in a family movie. Besides a considerable amount of physical violence, there is some obscured nudity, multiple occasions of crude language, as well as a scene in which a character gives the finger.
